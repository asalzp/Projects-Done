                <p>This magnificant 
                    piece is one of many great works of director Francis Ford Coppola based on a novel with the same
                    name by Mario Puzo. Wikipedia summarizes the story as below:
                    "   The plot begins with Don Vito Corleone declining an offer to join in the narcotics business with notorious drug lord Virgil Sollozzo, which leads to an assassination attempt. Meanwhile, Vito's oldest son Sonny takes over the family and Michael strikes back for the assassination attempt by killing Sollozzo and a corrupted police captain, forcing Michael to go to Sicily in hiding. While in Sicily, Michael travels around the country and meets a woman he marries but who is killed in a car bombing. Michael returns to America after the news of his brother Sonny's murder. Vito then turns over the reins of the family to Michael. Michael plans to move the family business to Las Vegas; but before the move, his father dies, and he plots the killing of the heads of the five families on the day of his nephew's baptism."
                    I, myself, found this movie AMAZING. The way movie is directed, casting, music, cinematography, camera angles, costumes,
                    all and all are at a level of perfectness beyond words! I never could take my eyes off of tv while watching this one!
                    I loved it and hope you guys will too! Go watch it ASAP if you haven't yet and let me know what you think!
